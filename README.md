# RajasthanHack


## Overview
We are proposing an end-to-end water management solution for the Rajasthan government that will ensure properd usage of water.
It includes an android application for each government body that is in charge of distributing water resources using Machine Learning.
The app would show real time purity levels of the nearby water bodies using IoT devices installed at the sites.
It would notify the people when a water tanker is being sent to their location along with its real-time location on the map.
The government is also sent an alert when a drought is being predicted in the next three months, implemented using an Artificial Neural Network, so that they can take appropriate measures.


## Features
- Drought prediction using an Artificial Neural Network
- Water need prediction, along with the division of the need into clean and regular water, using Machine Learning
- Real-time purity indication of nearby water resources
- Notification of water tankers sent for replenishment 


## How it works
